The infrastructure layer for your thinking. One database, one AI gateway, one chat channel. Any AI tool can access shared persistent memory — Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and anything that supports MCP — through a unified database with vector search and open protocol architecture.

## What You're Building

A two-part system:

1. **Capture System** (Steps 1–9) — A Slack integration that captures your thoughts automatically, embeds them with AI, extracts metadata, and stores everything in a searchable database.
2. **Retrieval System** (Steps 10–13) — An MCP server that lets any AI assistant search and write to your brain by semantic meaning.

## Requirements

- **Time:** ~45 minutes, no coding experience needed
- **Services (all free tier):**
  - [Supabase](https://supabase.com) — database + edge functions
  - [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) — AI gateway for embeddings and metadata extraction
  - [Slack](https://slack.com) — capture interface

## Cost

| Service | Cost |
| ------- | ---- |
| Slack | Free |
| Supabase | $0 (free tier) |
| Embeddings (text-embedding-3-small) | ~$0.02 per million tokens |
| Metadata extraction (GPT-4o-mini via OpenRouter) | ~$0.15 per million input tokens |
| **Estimated monthly total (20 thoughts/day)** | **$0.10–$0.30** |

## Credential Tracker

Keep this filled in as you go. You'll need these values across multiple steps.

| Credential | Where to find it | Your value |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Supabase Project Ref | Dashboard URL: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_REF` | |
| Supabase Project URL | Settings → API | |
| Supabase Service Role Key | Settings → API (secret key) | |
| OpenRouter API Key | openrouter.ai → Keys | |
| Slack Channel ID | Channel details → bottom of About tab | |
| Slack Bot Token | api.slack.com → Your App → OAuth & Permissions | |
| Edge Function URL (ingest) | Output of `supabase functions deploy` | |
| Edge Function URL (MCP) | Output of `supabase functions deploy` | |
| MCP Access Key | You generate this in Step 10 | |

## Part 1: Capture System

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click **New Project**
3. Name it `open-brain`
4. Generate a database password (save it somewhere safe)
5. Choose the region closest to you
6. Click **Create new project**

Your **Project Ref** is in the dashboard URL: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_REF`

Save it in the credential tracker above.

### Step 2: Database Setup

Open the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard (left sidebar). Run each of these blocks one at a time.

**Enable pgvector extension:**

```sql
create extension if not exists vector with schema extensions;
```

**Create the thoughts table:**

```sql
create table public.thoughts (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  content text not null,
  embedding extensions.vector(1536),
  metadata jsonb default '{}'::jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- Index for fast semantic search
create index on public.thoughts using ivfflat (embedding extensions.vector_cosine_ops)
  with (lists = 100);
```

**Create the semantic search function:**

```sql
create or replace function public.search_thoughts(
  query_embedding extensions.vector(1536),
  match_threshold float default 0.5,
  match_count int default 10
)
returns table (
  id bigint,
  content text,
  metadata jsonb,
  similarity float
)
language plpgsql
as $$
begin
  return query
  select
    t.id,
    t.content,
    t.metadata,
    1 - (t.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  from public.thoughts t
  where 1 - (t.embedding <=> query_embedding) > match_threshold
  order by t.embedding <=> query_embedding
  limit match_count;
end;
$$;
```

**Enable Row Level Security:**

```sql
alter table public.thoughts enable row level security;

create policy "Service role only" on public.thoughts
  for all
  using (auth.role() = 'service_role')
  with check (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

### Step 3: Save Connection Details

In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings → API**.

Save these to your credential tracker:
- **Project URL** — looks like `https://YOUR_REF.supabase.co`
- **Service Role Key** (the secret one, not the anon key) — starts with `eyJ...`

### Step 4: OpenRouter API Key

1. Sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Go to **Keys** and create a new API key named `open-brain`
3. Add **$5 in credits** (this lasts months at typical usage)
4. Save the API key to your credential tracker

### Step 5: Slack Channel

1. Open Slack and create a **private channel** named `capture`
2. Open channel details (click the channel name at the top)
3. Scroll to the bottom of the **About** tab — the **Channel ID** is there (starts with `C`)
4. Save it to your credential tracker

### Step 6: Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click **Create New App → From scratch**
2. Name it `Open Brain`, select your workspace
3. Go to **OAuth & Permissions** and add these **Bot Token Scopes:**
   - `channels:history`
   - `groups:history`
   - `chat:write`
4. Click **Install to Workspace** and authorize
5. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-`) to your credential tracker
6. In Slack, go to the `#capture` channel and type: `/invite @Open Brain`

### Step 7: Deploy the Ingest Edge Function

Install the Supabase CLI if you haven't:

```bash
# macOS
brew install supabase/tap/supabase

# Windows
scoop bucket add supabase https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install supabase

# npm (any platform)
npm i -g supabase
```

Then set up and deploy:

```bash
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```

Set your secrets:

```bash
supabase secrets set OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key
supabase secrets set SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
supabase secrets set SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C0123456789
```

Create and deploy the function:

```bash
supabase functions new ingest-thought
supabase functions deploy ingest-thought --no-verify-jwt
```

The function does this on each Slack message:
1. Receives the message via Slack Events API
2. Generates an embedding via OpenRouter (text-embedding-3-small)
3. Extracts metadata (category, people, action items) via GPT-4o-mini
4. Stores the thought in Supabase
5. Replies in Slack with a confirmation

Save the **Edge Function URL** from the deploy output to your credential tracker.

### Step 8: Connect Slack to the Edge Function

1. Back in [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps), open your app
2. Go to **Event Subscriptions** and toggle it **On**
3. Paste your Edge Function URL in the **Request URL** field — Slack will verify it
4. Under **Subscribe to bot events**, add:
   - `message.channels`
   - `message.groups`
5. Click **Save Changes**

### Step 9: Test Capture

Go to your `#capture` channel in Slack and type:

```text
Sarah mentioned she's thinking about leaving her job to start a consulting business
```

Within a few seconds, you should see a reply from the bot:

```text
Captured as person_note — career, consulting | People: Sarah | Action items: Check in with Sarah about consulting plans
```

If you see this, Part 1 is done. Your brain is capturing.

## Part 2: Retrieval System

### Step 10: Create an Access Key

Generate a random 64-character key:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
openssl rand -hex 32

# Windows PowerShell
-join ((1..32) | ForEach-Object { '{0:x2}' -f (Get-Random -Maximum 256) })
```

Save it as a Supabase secret:

```bash
supabase secrets set MCP_ACCESS_KEY=your-64-char-key-here
```

Save this key in your credential tracker — you'll need it to connect AI clients.

### Step 11: Deploy the MCP Server

Create and deploy the MCP edge function:

```bash
supabase functions new open-brain-mcp
supabase functions deploy open-brain-mcp --no-verify-jwt
```

The MCP server exposes four tools to any connected AI:

| Tool | What it does |
| ---- | ------------ |
| `search_thoughts` | Semantic search — find thoughts by meaning |
| `list_thoughts` | Browse recent thoughts with optional filters |
| `thought_stats` | Statistics on your captured content |
| `capture_thought` | Save a new thought directly from any AI |

Save the **MCP Function URL** to your credential tracker.

### Step 12: Connect to AI Clients

Your MCP Connection URL follows this pattern:

```text
https://YOUR_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/open-brain-mcp/mcp?key=YOUR_MCP_ACCESS_KEY
```

**Claude Desktop:**
1. Open Settings → Connectors
2. Click **Add custom connector**
3. Paste your MCP Connection URL

**ChatGPT (requires paid plan):**
1. Open Settings → Apps & Connectors
2. Click **Create connector**
3. Paste your MCP endpoint URL

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http open-brain https://YOUR_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/open-brain-mcp/mcp --header "x-brain-key: YOUR_MCP_ACCESS_KEY"
```

**Other MCP-compatible clients:**

Use the URL with a query parameter:

```text
https://YOUR_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/open-brain-mcp/mcp?key=YOUR_MCP_ACCESS_KEY
```

For clients that only support local stdio servers, use the `mcp-remote` bridge:

```bash
npx mcp-remote https://YOUR_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/open-brain-mcp/mcp --header "x-brain-key: YOUR_MCP_ACCESS_KEY"
```

### Step 13: Test Retrieval

Try these prompts in any connected AI client:

- **"What did I capture about career changes?"** — Uses semantic search to find thoughts by meaning
- **"What did I capture this week?"** — Browses recent thoughts
- **"Save this: decided to move launch to March 15"** — Captures a new thought directly

If your AI can search and return your thoughts, you're done. Your Open Brain is live.

## Troubleshooting

**Slack Request URL not verified**
Redeploy the edge function (`supabase functions deploy ingest-thought --no-verify-jwt`) and check the output for errors. The function must respond to Slack's verification challenge.

**Messages not triggering the function**
Verify both event types (`message.channels` and `message.groups`) are subscribed in Event Subscriptions. Also confirm the bot was invited to the channel.

**Duplicate database entries**
Slack retries if it doesn't get a response within 3 seconds. If your function is slow, duplicates can appear. Delete them manually from the SQL Editor:

```sql
delete from thoughts where id in (
  select id from (
    select id, row_number() over (partition by content, created_at::date order by id) as rn
    from thoughts
  ) t where rn > 1
);
```

**No confirmation reply in Slack**
Check that the bot token (`xoxb-...`) is set correctly and the `chat:write` scope is in the bot's permissions.

**401 errors from MCP**
Verify your access key matches exactly — check `supabase secrets list` and compare with what's in your AI client config.

**Search returns no results**
Make sure you have captured thoughts first. If you do, try lowering the match threshold:

```sql
select * from search_thoughts(
  (select embedding from thoughts order by created_at desc limit 1),
  0.3,  -- lower threshold
  10
);
```

## Architecture Notes

Unlike local MCP servers that require Node.js and credential management on your computer, this deployment runs entirely on Supabase infrastructure. Connections use simple URLs with no local dependencies.

- **Embedding model:** `text-embedding-3-small` generates 1536-dimensional vectors for semantic matching
- **Metadata extraction:** GPT-4o-mini via OpenRouter provides structured filtering (categories, people, action items)
- **Protocol:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) — the open standard for connecting AI tools to data sources
